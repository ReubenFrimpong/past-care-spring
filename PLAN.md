2. **Nominatim Integration**: Search-based location selection with autocomplete (same UX as members-page)
3. **Geographic Auto-Detect**: Automatically find members in affected locations using database queries
4. **Member Preview**: See who will be affected before saving the crisis
5. **Deduplication**: Members in multiple affected locations only counted once
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing crises with single location field still work

**Use Cases**:
- **Church-wide crises**: COVID-19, natural disasters, power outages - add all members with one click
- **Multi-location disasters**: Hurricane affects 3 cities - automatically detect members in all 3 areas
- **Regional emergencies**: Fire in specific neighborhoods - find members by suburb/district

### New Entities

## Development Standards & Guidelines

### Feature Completion Criteria
**CRITICAL**: A feature is NOT considered complete until ALL of the following are met:

1. **E2E Test Coverage** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Every feature MUST have comprehensive E2E tests
   - All E2E tests MUST pass before marking feature as complete
   - Test scenarios must cover:
     - Happy path (primary workflow)
     - Error handling (validation failures, network errors)
     - Edge cases (empty states, maximum values, boundary conditions)
     - User interactions (form submissions, dialogs, confirmations)
   - **Rule**: A complete feature is a feature that has E2E tests asserting the feature and passing

2. **Form Design Consistency** ⭐⭐⭐
   - All forms MUST follow the member-form design pattern
   - Consistent styling, layout, and validation patterns across the application
   - Reference implementation: `past-care-spring-frontend/src/app/member-form/`
   - **Rule**: Any form should be consistent with the member-form
   - Standard elements:
     - Form layout and spacing
     - Input field styling
     - Validation message display
     - Submit/Cancel button placement
     - Loading states
     - Error handling and display
     - Success notifications

3. **Backend-Frontend Sync** ⭐⭐
   - Backend entities must have corresponding frontend interfaces
   - API endpoints must have matching service methods
   - DTOs must align with frontend request/response types
   - All validations must be mirrored (backend + frontend)

4. **Documentation Requirements** ⭐
   - API endpoints documented in Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Complex business logic commented in code
   - Database migrations with descriptive names
   - README updates for new features
   - User-facing documentation for significant features

5. **Code Quality Standards** ⭐
   - Backend unit tests for service layer (80%+ coverage)
   - Frontend compilation with no TypeScript errors
   - No console errors in browser
   - Responsive design tested on mobile, tablet, desktop
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### JPA Best Practices
**Bidirectional Relationship Ownership**:
- Always modify the owning side of relationships to persist changes
- Example: For Member ↔ Fellowship (Member owns via @JoinTable):
  - ✅ Correct: `member.getFellowships().add(fellowship)`
  - ❌ Wrong: `fellowship.getMembers().add(member)` (won't persist)
- Use managed collections: `collection.clear()` + `collection.addAll(items)`
- Never replace managed collections: avoid `setCollection(new ArrayList<>())`

### UI/UX Standards

#### Mobile-First Design ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
- **Rule**: The app is primarily expected to be used on mobile so it should be very mobile friendly
- Design for mobile screens FIRST, then enhance for tablet and desktop
- Touch-friendly targets: minimum 44x44px (iOS) or 48x48px (Android)
- Responsive breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 768px (primary target)
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser DevTools
- Consider thumb zones for frequently used actions
- Avoid hover-dependent interactions (won't work on touch screens)
- Optimize images and assets for mobile bandwidth
- Use mobile-native patterns (bottom sheets, swipe gestures where appropriate)

#### High UX Standards ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
- **Rule**: UI and UX should conform to the highest standards
- Follow industry-standard design patterns (Material Design, iOS HIG)
- Intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent interaction patterns throughout the app
- Micro-interactions and smooth transitions (loading, success, error states)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Performance optimization (< 2s page load, < 100ms interaction response)
- Progressive disclosure (show essential info first, details on demand)
- Clear feedback for all user actions
- Error prevention through validation and confirmation dialogs
- Helpful error messages with recovery suggestions
- Zero friction for common tasks (minimal steps, smart defaults)

#### Table Usage Guidelines ⭐⭐
- **Rule**: Tables must be evaluated from a UX perspective before a decision is made
- **Default**: Prefer card-based layouts over tables for mobile
- Tables should ONLY be used when:
  - Comparing multiple data points across many rows is essential
  - Desktop/tablet is the primary viewing context
  - Data is tabular in nature and loses meaning in other formats
- When tables are necessary:
  - Make them responsive (horizontal scroll, stack columns, or convert to cards on mobile)
  - Provide mobile alternatives (filters, search, detail views)
  - Use sticky headers for long tables
  - Enable sorting and filtering
  - Consider virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **Better alternatives for mobile**:
  - Card-based grids (current Members, Fellowships, Visitors pages)
  - List views with expandable details
  - Summary cards with drill-down capability
  - Dashboard widgets with key metrics

#### General UI Standards
- Modern card-based layouts with gradients and shadows
- Consistent color scheme across all pages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Skeleton loaders for data fetching
- Proper spacing and whitespace (breathing room)
- Readable typography (minimum 16px for body text on mobile)
- High contrast for text readability (4.5:1 minimum ratio)

### Testing Workflow
1. Write E2E test scenarios FIRST (TDD approach)
2. Implement backend functionality
3. Implement frontend functionality
4. Run E2E tests and fix until all pass
5. Mark feature as complete ONLY when tests pass

### E2E Testing Best Practices ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

#### Test Isolation and User Management
- **Rule**: For every test, create your own unique user before logging in
- **Why**: Prevents test interference, ensures clean state, avoids shared data conflicts
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  test('feature name', async ({ page }) => {
    // 1. Create unique user for this test
    const uniqueEmail = `test-${Date.now()}-${Math.random()}@example.com`;
    await page.goto('/register');
    await page.fill('input[name="email"]', uniqueEmail);
    // ... complete registration

    // 2. Login with the unique user
    await page.goto('/login');
    await page.fill('input[name="email"]', uniqueEmail);
    // ... complete login

    // 3. Run test assertions
    // ...
  });
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Tests can run in parallel without conflicts
  - Each test has isolated data (church, members, fellowships)
  - Failures in one test don't affect others
  - Easy to debug - each test's data is independent
  - No need for complex cleanup/teardown logic

#### Test Data Setup - Simulate Real Usage ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
- **Rule**: Create all dependent entities required for the feature to be complete because tests should simulate real usage
- **Why**: Tests must reflect actual user workflows and data relationships
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  test('dashboard shows birthdays this week', async ({ page }) => {
    // 1. Create unique user
    await createUniqueUserAndLogin(page);

    // 2. Create dependent entities (members with birthdays)
    await createMemberWithBirthday(page, 'John', 'Doe', 1); // Tomorrow
    await createMemberWithBirthday(page, 'Jane', 'Smith', 3); // In 3 days

    // 3. Navigate to feature being tested
    await page.goto('/dashboard');

    // 4. Verify feature works with real data
    await expect(page.locator('.widget-card:has-text("Birthdays This Week")')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('.widget-item-name:has-text("John Doe")')).toBeVisible();
  });
  ```
- **Examples of Dependent Entities**:
  - Testing attendance? Create sessions, members, and records
  - Testing fellowships? Create members, leaders, and join requests
  - Testing dashboard widgets? Create members with relevant dates/data
  - Testing reports? Create sufficient data for meaningful reports
- **Benefits**:
  - Tests validate complete user workflows, not just UI
  - Catches integration bugs between related features
  - Ensures data relationships work correctly
  - Provides confidence that real users will have working features

#### Other E2E Best Practices
- Use unique identifiers for test data (timestamps, random strings)
- Avoid hardcoded IDs or assumptions about existing data
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios
- Use page object pattern for reusable components
- Add descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include wait conditions for async operations
- Verify visual elements (not just data) for UX validation
- Helper functions should be reusable across tests (createMember, createFellowship, etc.)
- Clean data setup: create → test → verify, no manual database manipulation

---

## Notes
- All modules designed with TDD mindset
- E2E testing mandatory for all features
- International support baked into all modules
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance
- Regular security audits
- Performance budgets enforced

### Critical Rules ⭐⭐⭐
- **A feature is complete only when E2E tests pass**
- **All forms must follow member-form design patterns**
- **The app is primarily expected to be used on mobile - design mobile-first**
- **UI and UX should conform to the highest standards**
- **Tables must be evaluated from a UX perspective before use - prefer cards for mobile**
- **For every E2E test, create your own unique user before logging in**
- **Create all dependent entities required for the feature - tests should simulate real usage**
